# my-homepage
Here are the homepages that I made during the Fullstack training program at Oulu vocational school (or OSAO for short).

The homepages consist of 
- an index page with a simple summary
- my CV in HTML form
- a page with links to my other works and 
- a dropdown list of the JavaScript and PHP exercises we made during the training program.

I have also included an older version of the homepages (inside "vanhat_kotisivut" folder) in which I didn't yet use Bootstrap as well as the MySQL database that was used in the PHP exercises (inside "files/MySQL database" folder). 

The homepages can also be found at the schools servers at https://geronimo.okol.org/~niklep until they are removed by the IT guys at OSAO.
